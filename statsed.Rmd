During the COVID-19 pandemic, I started writing parodies of famous songs to teach Statistics to undergraduate students.

You can access the 10-song suite I call the _Summary Song Saga_ in this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm53uqt-ln0&list=PLZ0e2Vq6gAWLTI8X_rzFgF59uEXFfbSrM). It includes:

You can also find other short songs and videos in my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rafamoral) and [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@rafa_moral) pages.

I was honoured to receive the [Maths Week Ireland Award](https://www.mathsweek.ie/2022/award-public-awareness-of-maths/) for this initiative.

I also produced videos to explain statistical concepts associated with epidemiology as part of the SciComm initiative by the Department of Health (see the articles published by the [Irish Times](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/i-decided-to-sing-about-the-pandemic-people-seemed-to-like-it-1.4795068) and [Irish Independent](https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/irelands-tiktok-scientists-describe-trolling-and-misinformation-as-they-took-part-in-government-covid-campaign-41318812.html)).
